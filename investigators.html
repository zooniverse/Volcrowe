<p>The VOLCROWE project brings together a truly cross-disciplinary team of researchers to model a range of aspects of volunteering, crowdsourcing and online citizen science projects. The team of investigators contains internationally recognised expertise in the economic and management sciences including social networking, supply chain management, citizen science and cosmology. One of the major aims of the project is to provide a theoretical and methodological basis for developing this initial investigation into a full scale international network of crowdsourcing and citizen science expertise within the economic and management sciences.</p>

  <p><b><a href="http://www.port.ac.uk/departments/faculties/portsmouthbusinessschool/academicstaff/economicsandfinance/title,164008,en.html">Dr Joe Cox</a>, Economics and Finance, University of Portsmouth (PI)</b>:<br>
  Dr Cox is currently a Principal Lecturer in economics at the University of Portsmouth Business School. His research interests are focused around the digital economy, including the economics of illegal file sharing and the video gaming industry. He has published a number of related papers in peer-reviewed academic journals, including the European Journal of Operational Research, Managerial and Decision Economics, The Journal of Cultural Economics and Information Economics and Policy. He was the recipient of the 2011 Neil Rackham prize for research dissemination and a member of the Association for Cultural Economics International (ACEI). Dr Cox brings to the project both a specialist background in economics, as well as knowledge of the analytical and statistical tools required to test assumptions of theoretical behavioural modelling against interrelationships between key variables appearing in ‘big’ datasets and to interpret in accordance with economic principles and ideas.</p>

  <p><b><a href="http://business.leeds.ac.uk/about-us/faculty-staff/member/profile/gary-graham/">Dr Gary Graham</a>, Leeds University Business School, University of Leeds (CI)</b>:<br>
  Dr Graham is a lecturer based at Leeds University Business School and is a member of the NEMODE network, as well as a founding member of the Supply Chain and Operations Management Research Group. His work to date focuses on the impact of the internet and digital technologies on supply chains, logistics and distribution operations. More recently, he has collaborated with Professor Callaghan at Essex University and Brian David Johnson at Intel on building strategic prototypes of future technology/smart cities, business models, and imagination-driven innovation. He has authored two books and has published thirty research papers. Dr Graham is currently PI on a £75,000 ESRC funded European Manufacturing Innovation project. In 2005, he was awarded an Outstanding Guest Editor award by Emerald Publishers. Gary has previously been invited to be a Visiting International Research Scholar in the School of Journalism and Mass Communication at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (October 2008/2011) and the School of Engineering at the University of California – Silicon Valley (February, 2009) and University of San Diego (April, 2009). Dr Graham brings a specialist knowledge in management sciences which are essential to the collection and interpretation of data relating to the operation of citizen science projects and the effective management of volunteer resources.</p>

  <p><b><a href="http://www.mbs.ac.uk/research/people/profiles/agreenhill">Dr Anita Greenhill</a>, Manchester Business School, University of Manchester (CI)</b>:<br>
  Dr Greenhill is a member of the NEMODE network, the eResearch Centre University of Manchester; as well as the Centre of Research on Social and Cultural Change (CRESC). Dr Greenhill has successfully conducted research into the changing role of the city, local communities and their use of community news media in the digital age. Key areas of expertise are in the areas of networked usage of technology within community, organisational and business settings. Under this broad theme, she has specialised interests and is actively conducting research into technologically enabled work, spatiality, and internet/ World Wide Web usage in organisations. Dr Greenhill has a growing body of published work consisting of more than sixty publications, ranging from examination of virtual space and the impact that new technological developments are having on organisations and people to the use of technology on techno-religious practice. Dr Greenhill recently carried out a research project for the National Coordinating Centre of Public Engagement (NCCPE) examining the engagement practices between Universities and Local Communities, as well as a JISC project on Twitter analysis workbench development within the eResearch Centre. Dr Greenhill brings to the team a specialist knowledge of digital networks and online communities that is essential to understanding the motivations of citizen science volunteers and the optimisation of the processes required to enhance and sustain engagement.</p>

  <p><b><a href="http://www2.physics.ox.ac.uk/contacts/people/lintott">Dr Chris Lintott</a>, Department of Physics, Oxford University (CI)</b>:<br>
  Dr Lintott is the Principal Investigator for the Zooniverse and Chair of the Citizen Science Alliance. As an astronomer, he has used crowdsourcing in his own work on galaxy evolution and formation, on planet discovery and on star formation within the Milky Way. His current research interests include the development of more efficient models for directing crowd sourced attention, in collaboration with machine learning and artificial intelligence researchers in Oxford and elsewhere. Dr Lintott holds a permanent researchership in Oxford where he is also a Junior Research Fellow at New College. His work with the Zooniverse was recognized by the Royal Society, which bestowed the Kohn Award upon him in 2011. Dr Lintott provides a key input to the project in his role as the ‘Zookeeper’, granting direct access to data, users and managers within the Zooniverse, as well as providing a clear route to achieving impact through his role as Chair of the Citizen Science Alliance.</p>

  <p><b><a href="http://icg.port.ac.uk/~mastersk/">Dr Karen Masters</a>, Institute of Cosmology and Gravitation, University of Portsmouth (CI)</b>:<br>
  Dr Masters is Research Fellow at the Institute of Cosmology and Gravitation at the University of Portsmouth. Since 2008, she has been a leading scientist working with the Galaxy Zoo project, publishing results on a variety of topics related to galaxy evolution based on combining the classifications from citizen scientists with other information on galaxies. This work has been supported over the last 4 years by two prestigious personal fellowships - the 2008 Peter and Patricia Gruber Foundation IAU Fellowship (only one is awarded annually in this international competition) and an Early Career Fellowship from The Leverhulme Trust (2010-2012; the only one in astronomy awarded that year). The importance of her work within the astronomical community was recently recognised by an invitation to give one of four prestigious ‘Invited Discourses’ at the 28th General Assembly of the International Astronomical Union (IAU) in August 2012, where she talked about ‘The Zoo of Galaxies’. Karen also has a strong interest in the use of Galaxy Zoo to help educate the general public about astronomy and science in general, and has been engaged in the Zooniverse education group, as well as a variety of outreach efforts at ICG where she holds the post of Outreach Co-ordinator. Her expertise in social engagement and public outreach is helping the project to achieve impact through the dissemination of findings.</p>
