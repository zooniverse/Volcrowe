<P><I>Why are you asking socio-demographic questions?</I><BR />
Past studies have found that the answers to these questions are sometimes related to participation levels in other voluntary projects, so your responses help us determine the extent to which that is true of participation in Zooniverse.</P>

<P>In addition, the answers to the other attitudinal questions we asked on previous pages can vary based on these socio-demographic quantities, so in order to control for those variations we need to have these responses.</P>

<P><I>Note:</I> all of your answers will be kept confidential and anonymous.</P>
