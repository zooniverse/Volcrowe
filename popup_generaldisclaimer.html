<P>We will not ask for your real name nor any identifying details such as an e-mail address; the questionnaire can be completed anonymously and all reasonable measures will be taken to ensure complete confidentiality. We do ask you to enter your Zooniverse ID so that the research team can match your survey responses to your recorded patterns of use and engagement with Zooniverse projects. No member of the Zooniverse team will have access to the raw survey data and no non-Zooniverse member of the VOLCROWE research team will be given access to any other identifying information relating to your Zooniverse account.</P>

<P>As this is an online survey, responses from completed questionnaires will automatically be entered into a spreadsheet and collated electronically; the form is exclusively electronic and no hard copies will be retained.  Once the survey has closed, the summary spreadsheet of responses will be used by the project team as the basis for academic study and analysis.  Published academic papers will only present aggregated representations of the whole data set and will not make reference to or present any individual responses.  A summary spreadsheet of responses will eventually be made available publicly via the project website (link above) and may be used as the basis for further collaborative research activity, potentially involving academics outside of the original project team.</P>

<P>If you wish to learn more about the results of the research please visit the project website and submit an enquiry form.  Working papers and published output based on this research will also be available for download via the project website. Updates on the research progress of the project team will also be made via the Zooniverse blog and the project's Twitter feed (<A HREF="http://www.twitter.com/volcrowe" TARGET=_blank>www.twitter.com/volcrowe</A>).</P>
