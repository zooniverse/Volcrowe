<P><I>Why do you want to know where I live?</I><BR />
Some of the later questions are country specific, so these questions determine which of those later questions to ask. They also allow us to check to make sure we have a range of responses from around the world so that the geographic distribution of responses is similar to the worldwide distribution of Zooniverse volunteers.</P>

<P><I>Why do you want to know how I feel about my contributions to the Zooniverse?</I><BR />
The goal of this study is to understand how well economic models of volunteering apply to participation in the Zooniverse. These attitudinal questions help us understand volunteer motivation in that context.</P>

<P><I>Why the hypothetical situations?</I><BR />
These questions are another way of asking about motivation and the way volunteers frame their contributions, within the economic context that motivates this study (hence the hypothetical financial aspect). </P>
<P><I>Note:</I> all of your answers will be kept confidential and anonymous.</P>
