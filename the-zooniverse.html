<h2>The Zooniverse</h2>
<hr>

<p>The VOLCROWE project is specifically examining volunteer behaviour within the collection of online citizen science projects comprising the Zooniverse (<a href="http://www.zooniverse.org">www.zooniverse.org</a>). These sites rely on volunteer contributions to analyse and enhance immense, valuable datasets relating to topics as diverse as the search for extra-solar planets, exploration of the ocean floor and finding the cure for cancer. Volunteers undertake a range of online tasks; for example, participants in Galaxy Zoo (<a href="http://www.galaxyzoo.org">www.galaxyzoo.org</a>) are asked to answer simple questions on the properties of galaxies. Within 24 hours of launch in 2007, Galaxy Zoo was receiving 70,000 classifications per hour and collected more than 50 million classifications from almost 150,000 volunteers in the first year of operation. The success of Galaxy Zoo led to the birth of the Zooniverse, a cluster of more than twenty on-going citizen science projects with more than 870,000 registered volunteers and counting. Voluntary crowdsourcing and co-creative activities of this type hold as yet unacknowledged and unknown potential and explorations of new volunteer-driven economic models can help further quantify the potential of networked engagement. </p>

<p>The Zooniverse platform offers a fantastic opportunity for investigating models of motivation and performance, as the software includes the ability to ask survey questions as part of the classification experience and to provide feedback to users as and when required. Although each project under the Zooniverse umbrella is unique, a shared approach to design and development minimises the differences, allowing the team to make comparisons between projects as well as studying behaviour specific to a single initiative. Data generated directly from Zooniverse sites is being used to develop and/or test theoretical economic and business models of volunteering. The VOLCROWE project is therefore novel in its exploration of the type of voluntary-embedded value creation model exemplified by the Zooniverse.</p>
