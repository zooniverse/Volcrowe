<P>As this is an online survey, responses from completed questionnaires will automatically be entered into a spreadsheet and collated electronically; the form is exclusively electronic and no hard copies will be retained.  Once the survey has closed, the summary spreadsheet of responses will be used by the project team as the basis for academic study and analysis.  Published academic papers will only present aggregated representations of the whole data set and will not make reference to or present any individual responses.  A summary spreadsheet of responses will eventually be made available publicly via the project website (link above) and may be used as the basis for further collaborative research activity, potentially involving academics outside of the original project team.</P>

<P>If you wish to learn more about the results of the research please visit the project website and submit an enquiry form.  Working papers and published output based on this research will also be available for download via the project website. Updates on the research progress of the project team will also be made via the Zooniverse blog and the project's Twitter feed (<A HREF="http://www.twitter.com/volcrowe" TARGET=_blank>www.twitter.com/volcrowe</A>).</P>
