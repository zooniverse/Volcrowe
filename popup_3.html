<P><I>Why do you want to know about religion?</I><BR />
Religiosity can be an important factor in attitudes and lifestyles, as well as sometimes being related to participation levels in other voluntary projects. We therefore ask these questions for the same reason we asked the other socio-demographic questions. </P>

<P>We also recognise that some may object to sharing this information, so we have made these questions optional. If you feel comfortable answering these questions, the information will be extremely valuable to the research study. All of your answers will be kept confidential and anonymous.</P>
